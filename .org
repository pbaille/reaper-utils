* Lua

Main repo for lua code


** Setup

I use =luarocks= as package manager
[[~/.luarocks/][lua-user-dir]]
alternatively I use =luaver=

** fennel

I will mainly use the fennel langage to interop with Lua

** Reaper

[[~/Library/ApplicationSupport/REAPER/Scripts/][scripts dir]]

The main motivation for using Lua is to interoperate with the reaper DAW

*** [[file:ruteal.fnl::(local {&as utils][ruteal.fnl]]
main utils file for reaper interp

*** [[/Users/pierrebaille/Code/Lua/socket-repl.fnl][socket-repl.fnl]]
 this file is compiled in lua and added to reaper

 - From reaper action menu (?) search and run socket-repl.lua
 - from a fnl source file buffer =(spc m R)= will enable reaper-mode
   expression can be evaluated using =pb/send-fnl-s-expression-to-reaper-socket-repl=
   this should popup a console window in reaper.

*** [[/Users/pierrebaille/Code/Lua/socket.lua][socket.lua]]
this file load the reaper modified socket library (duplicated from REAPER/Sripts dir)

** Clojure interop

Connect to a running repl with
[[file:xp/nrepl-client.fnl::(fn receive \[conn\]][nrepl-client.fnl]]


* Things to do
** DONE insert a note
using the map representation of rutils
insert a note at point from repl
** DONE insert a noon score
call noon using nrepl
insert the score at cursor position in reaper
- get score0 and turn it into ruteals note format
  see [[~/Code/Lua/xp/nrepl-client.fnl]] for clj interop
- noon should expose a way to get data suitable for midi insertion
  see the code following previously mentioned clj interop
** DONE create a convenient interface to send score to reaper
- tried to use fennel repl as base but encountered some inconveniences
  inserting a clj generated score into fennel code template is hard
- try the same from clojure
  send to reaper socket directly from clojure
  see [[file:~/Code/WIP/noon/src/noon/utils/reaper.clj::comment (send-fennel (+ 4 5)][noon/utils/reaper.clj]]
** TODO reload the reaper socket repl script remotely
- I will need to make addition and changes to =ruteal.fnl= along the way
  there should be an easy way to compile and reload, making those changes
  immediately available in reaper-repl
